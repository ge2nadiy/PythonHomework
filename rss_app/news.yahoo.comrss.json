Photograph: Christopher Aluka Berry/ReutersPete Buttigieg\u2019s 2020 campaign is returning thousands of dollars in donations from two top Washington lawyers who represented Brett Kavanaugh in his controversial confirmation hearing, saying it will not accept funds from people who helped secure the justice\u2019s seat on the supreme court.Buttigieg\u2019s campaign received $7,200 from Alexandra Walsh \u2013 $3,150 of which had already been returned because it exceeded limits \u2013 and attended a fundraiser in July that was co-hosted by the Washington lawyer. Buttigieg also received $2,800 from Beth Wilkinson, Walsh\u2019s law partner, who also represented Kavanaugh.When asked by the Guardian about the donations, the campaign said it had overlooked the lawyers\u2019 role in the Kavanaugh confirmation and had made a mistake in accepting the donations.It said: \u201cWith nearly 700,000 donors, a contribution we would otherwise refuse sometimes gets through. We believe the women who have courageously spoken out about Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s assault and misconduct, and we thank the Guardian for bringing this contribution to our attention.\u201dA spokesperson added: \u201c[Kavanaugh] should have never been put on the supreme court and this campaign will not accept donations from those who played a role in making that happen. Accordingly, we will be returning this contribution and others from this firm.\u201dWalsh and Wilkinson are frequent donors to Democratic causes. During this 2020 election cycle, Wilkinson has donated $1,000 to the California senator Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign and $2,800 to the Colorado senator Michael Bennet\u2019s campaign. Wilkinson also gave $2,800 to the New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who has since dropped out of the race and has been an outspoken critic of Kavanaugh.The Washington law firm Wilkinson Walsh Eskovitz represented the then nominee for the supreme court after Christine Blasey Ford accused him of sexually assaulting her when both were high school students in suburban Maryland. Walsh and Wilkinson led the charge defending Kavanaugh, even as more accusations of sexual misconduct were unearthed, and painted the judge as the victim of an \u201coutrageous\u201d campaign.In one case, Wilkinson questioned why women who accused Kavanaugh of assault had not immediately gone to the police to report alleged assaults, instead of members of Congress, and insisted that Kavanaugh treated women with dignity and respect.The judge has denied all of the allegations against him.In another case, Walsh sought to downplay comments that were made in Kavanaugh\u2019s high school yearbook. When the New York Times reported that Kavanaugh was listed as a member of the \u201cRenate Alumni\u201d \u2013 a reference to a classmate from a neighbouring Catholic girls\u2019 school that appeared to insinuate sexual conquest \u2013 Walsh was quoted in a statement as saying that Kavanaugh had been friends with Renate in high school and had \u201cadmired her very much\u201d. She also stated that the two had once shared a \u201cbrief kiss goodnight\u201d.When asked about the reference, Renate Dolphin told the New York Times that the insinuation in Kavanaugh\u2019s yearbook was \u201churtful and simply untrue\u201d. She also denied Walsh\u2019s assertion that she and Kavanaugh had ever kissed.Walsh did not respond to a request for comment about the Buttigieg campaign\u2019s decision to reject her donations. Wilkinson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Harris and Bennet campaigns did not return a request for comment on the donations they received from Wilkinson. Gillibrand\u2019s office also did not return a request for comment.The Buttigieg campaign has been a vocal critic of Kavanaugh and has said that, if elected, he would choose a supreme court justice similar to Ruth Bader Ginsberg, who shared his \u201cprogressive values\u201d."

      "Discription": "More than once a month in the past year, gunfire has turned deadly, gun control advocates findPolice officers take part in active shooter response training exercise at Fountain middle school in Fountain, Colorado, in June 2017. Photograph: Dougal Brownlie/APA gun is fired on a school campus in America nearly twice a week. Suicide, homicides, a police shooting, attacks on students by other students: more than once a month this past year, gunfire on American school and university campuses has turned deadly, according to a database of school gunfire incidents compiled by advocates.In the latest in a series of brutal shootings in California, and 11-year-old boy and a 16-year-old boy were shot to death in the parking lot of an elementary school in Union City, California, in the early hours of Saturday morning. Police had no immediate motive for the shooting, but said that a suspect or suspects had fired into the van the boys were sitting in multiple times.Schools are one of the safest places for kids in the United States, and shootings in and around schools represent only a tiny fraction of the violence that children face here on a daily basis. But even the small amount of gun violence that occurs at American schools adds up.Since the Columbine shooting in 1999, at least 233,000 kids across 243 schools have been exposed to gun violence during school hours, a Washington Post investigation found.Experts are quick to put that number in context. Researchers found that nearly 1,300 American children aged 17 and younger die from gunshot wounds each year, and they are more likely to be killed in homes or neighborhoods than at school.Domestic violence is particularly deadly. In San Diego, a domestic violence mass shooting claimed the lives of three young boys and their mother, all shot to death by the boys\u2019 father on 16 November, according to police. The fourth brother, nine-year-old Ezekiel Valdivia, died on Saturday afternoon, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported.That single domestic violence shooting was deadlier than any of the school shooting attacks in the United States so far in 2019, according to tallies compiled by the Washington Post and the New York Times.\u201cGunfire on school grounds is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to how gun violence affects children and teenagers,\u201d said Ruhi Bengali, a senior associate at Everytown for Gun Safety, the country\u2019s largest gun control advocacy organization.But tracking gun violence on school grounds, as Everytown has done since after the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school shooting, does provide a window into the many ways gun violence burdens young people, even in places that are \u201cinherently meant to be safe spaces for learning\u201d, Bengali said.Everytown\u2019s analysis found that 20% of all gunfire on school grounds comes from unintentional shootings, but that even these \u201cactually resulted in a fair number of injuries. Gun suicides, with no intent to harm anyone else, represented 12% of all incidents,\u201d she said.As with other kinds of gun violence in America, students of color, and black students in particular, were disproportionately affected.Black students make up only 15% of the school population for K-12 schools, yet represented 24% of student victims in instances of gunfire on school grounds, she said.For the students affected by ongoing gun violence in and around their schools, local officials can offer additional counselors, but little evidence of national change on gun laws: Republican lawmakers have blocked any substantive gun control laws for the past quarter-century.In Union City, where the two kids were killed in the elementary school parking lot, students are out of school this week for the Thanksgiving holiday, but will have \u201cdistrict and community mental health providers available\u201d when they return to school, spokesman John Mattos said.Not far away, students at Carl Munck elementary school in Oakland have also had additional counselors available to them. The president of the school\u2019s Parent Teacher Association, Misty Smith Walton, was shot to death outside her Oakland apartment earlier this month.Her death wasn\u2019t a school shooting. But that didn\u2019t mean it does not affect the school.\u201cShe was always looking to improve her sons\u2019 classes and their school, always there to do whatever was needed in the front office, on the yard or anywhere else on campus,\u201d the superintendent said in a statement, calling her death a \u201chorrific crime\u201d."

      "Discription": "Early Saturday morning, 51-year-old Yvonne Serrano called Florida authorities to report a grisly scene in the driveway of her Coral Springs home.\u201cI just walked out and there is a car in my driveway with a dead body,\u201d she told the 911 dispatcher. \u201cThere\u2019s blood..she\u2019s been here for a while,\u201d she added. \u201cShe\u2019s bleeding everywhere.\u201dDuring the frantic, five-minute phone call, Serrano insisted she had no idea what a dead body was doing in her driveway. But hours later\u2014after changing her story multiple times\u2014Serrano was charged with second-degree murder and tampering with physical evidence for allegedly shooting 21-year-old Daniela Tabares outside her home, then trying to cover it up, Coral Springs police said.Authorities said the pair had gone to the movies and a bar on Friday night with friends from their local gym, a night of fun that ended with a bullet in Tabares\u2019 forehead.\u00a0California Man Who Rapped About Burying His Girlfriend Is Charged With Her Murder\u201cDaniela is an inspiration. She is the [sic] shining example of what the best of us can only try to be,\u201d the gym that organized the group event said in a Facebook statement on Monday. \u201cIt shines through in the joy, laughter,\u00a0 and loving sassiness she shared with us. It shines through in the boundless love she gave us and the selfless care she took for the people around her. We cannot measure her loss.\u201dAccording to a police affidavit obtained by The Daily Beast, deputies arrived at Serrano\u2019s house early Saturday morning to find Tabares \u201cpartially inside the driver\u2019s side of a Nissan Kicks\u201d\u2014her right foot still inside the SUV while the rest of her body was on the driveway.\u00a0\u201cThe victim was lying on her back with a fatal gunshot wound on her forehead,\u201d the affidavit states. The medical examiner later determined that Tabares died from a single gunshot to the head by a 9mm pistol.Serrano initially told police she\u2019d \u201cdiscovered\u201d the body on her way to the gym, but when authorities arrived, she \u201cwas not dressed in gym attire and did not appear ready to go for a work out,\u201d according to the affidavit.\u00a0The 51-year-old admitted to police during questioning that she knew Tabares, saying they\u2019d seen the movie 21 Bridges together at around 7:30 p.m. the night before. While they \u201cdid not sit together,\u201d Serrano told police the two went as a \u201cpart of a very large group of friends\u201d who all attended the \u201cTraining for Warriors\u201d gym in Coral Springs.Sarah Stern\u2019s Childhood Friend Found Guilty of Murdering Her for Her InheritanceThe group went to a bar, World of Beer, after the movie, the affidavit states. The gastropub\u2019s surveillance video shows Tabares and Serrano \u201cconversing, laughing and drinking for several hours\u201d before leaving the bar together.Serrano told police she had \u201coriginally mentioned taking an Uber home from the bar,\u201d but Tabares \u201cvolunteered to drive\u201d her home. Surveillance video from her neighborhood shows Tabares pulling into Serrano\u2019s driveway at around 2 a.m. Her headlights turned off about five minutes later, and the car remained in the same position until police arrived about three hours later, the affidavit states.\u00a0When police questioned Serrano about her story\u2019s discrepancies, she then stated she\u2019d \u201cblacked out\u201d at a bar and \u201chad no recollection of how she got home,\u201d according to the report. All \u201cshe remembered after World of Beer was waking up in her own bed\u201d early the next morning, she told police.\u00a0A few hours later, Serrano changed her story again, stating she actually woke up in Tabares\u2019 passenger seat at around 5:55 a.m. and saw the driver\u2019s door open and the 21-year-old \u201clying in the driveway,\u201d police said. At that point, she also admitted she had a concealed weapons permit and three guns\u2014including a 9mm pistol that she usually carried around but had removed and placed under her bed after calling the police.\u201cThe defendant advised that she then changed out of a white tank top she was wearing and place it in the washing machine\u201d because it had blood on it, the affidavit states.Family Sues Man They Say Left Their Daughter to Die on Florida HighwayPolice said her pistol and its holder tested positive for human blood, and linked shell casings found inside Tabares\u2019 car to the weapon.\u00a0\u00a0It was not immediately clear if Serrano, who is currently being held at the Broward County Jail without bond, has an attorney. Tabares\u2019 family did not immediately respond to The Daily Beast\u2019s requests for comment.\u00a0Tabares\u2019 friends paid tribute to the 21-year-old on social media, calling her a selfless person with a \u201cgood soul.\u201d\u201cMy BFF always tried to help! Always nice to people! Always smiling!,\u201d one of Tabares friends, Karo Miller, wrote on Facebook Monday. \u201cCan\u2019t even find the words!\u201d\u201cDaniela Maya Tabares, such a good soul!

      "Discription": "New data renews concerns about racial profiling, just weeks after viral video showed police detaining a black man who was eating a sandwichPassengers wait for a Bart train to depart the Fruitvale station in Oakland, California. Photograph: Ben Margot/APPolice officers for the San Francisco Bay Area commuter train system disproportionately target black riders with citations for eating and drinking, according to new data, renewing concerns about racial profiling.The Bay Area Rapid Transit (Bart) data was released following a viral video showing police handcuffing a 31-year-old black man who was cited for eating a breakfast sandwich on his way to work. The new records show that more than 81% of people stopped for eating and drinking on Bart since 2014 were people of color, and that the vast majority of them were black.Stops for eating and drinking on trains or platforms are infrequent within Bart, the train system that runs between San Francisco, Oakland and surrounding suburbs. Of 55 people cited for this offense over the last five years, 33 were black passengers, representing 60% of the citations. Nine of the stops were white passengers, seven were listed as Hispanic, five were categorized as \u201cother\u201d and one was unknown, according to the data, which was obtained by the San Francisco Examiner.Only 10% of Bart\u2019s total riders are black, meaning they are six times more likely than others to be stopped for eating and drinking. Ridership data, collected last year, showed that 35% of overall riders are white, 32% are Asian/Pacific Islander and 17% are Latino.Bart spokeswoman Alicia Trost said in an email that the data shows citations are \u201cvery rare\u201d and are \u201chanded out at stations across the system\u201d.She said: \u201cWhen an officer witnesses someone eating, they remind the rider that eating is not allowed and if the rider puts the food away no citation is necessary. It is a rare occurrence to need to issue a citation after reminding the rider not to eat.\u201dJohn Burris, a civil rights lawyer representing Steve Foster, the man stopped in the recent video, said Tuesday that the data was not surprising and was evidence of racial profiling. \u201cThis is a form of biased policing, and it\u2019s very harmful to African Americans. Other people eat sandwiches all the time, and they don\u2019t get stopped.\u201dThe 15-minute video that received national attention showed a white Bart police officer stopping Foster at the station in Pleasant Hill, north-east of Oakland. The footage showed the officer holding on to Foster\u2019s backpack and telling him he was not free to go until he identified himself and that he was resisting arrest. Backup officers arrived, and Foster was handcuffed and taken away in front of morning commuters.The citation he received required him to pay a $250 fine or do 48 hours of community service.\u201cIt was so insulting to him and disturbing,\u201d said Burris. \u201cHe was humiliated in front of all the people on Bart.\u201dThe video sparked protests and widespread criticism, and Bart leaders eventually apologized and promised to investigate. Bob Powers, Bart\u2019s general manager, said at the time he was \u201cdisappointed how the situation unfolded\u201d.A citation or arrest for a minor infraction like eating can escalate to a significantly more serious conflict, said Cat Brooks, the co-founder of the Anti Police-Terror Project in Oakland.\u201cEating a sandwich is certainly not a reason to throw yet another black body into the criminal justice system,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to hold these cops accountable for racial profiling.\u201dBart police have long faced scrutiny for brutality and racial profiling, in particular following the 2009 killing of Oscar Grant, an unarmed 22-year-old shot dead on the Fruitvale station platform. There have since been a number of other killings and allegations of abuse by Bart police.Bart should not be citing anyone for eating in the first place, Brooks said.Burris said there should be better training to prevent biased policing, and that it was wrong to handcuff riders for eating.Trost, the Bart spokeswoman, said all officers receive training in \u201cfair and impartial policing, bias-based policing \u2026 and de-escalation\u201d.The Bart controversy comes as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in New York is facing intense backlash over a number of viral videos of police, including the arrest of a food vendor selling churros, and an incident in which officers pulled guns on a teenager accused of fare evasion."

Shall we integrate to a place where there\u2019s no difference being made between men and women? We definitely shall not.\u201dAliyev\u2019s remarks mark a departure from the national security strategy he approved in 2007, which said energy-rich Azerbaijan targets membership in European and Euro-Atlantic alliances. The majority Muslim but secular nation of 10 million people sandwiched between Iran and Russia forged close political and economic ties with the U.S. and the European Union after declaring independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991.The president\u2019s speech \u201cwas his acknowledgment of the failure of secularism and western values in Azerbaijan,\u201d prominent Azeri journalist Khadija Ismayil wrote on Facebook. Ismayil, who\u2019s known for investigative reports into Aliyev\u2019s undeclared family businesses, was sentenced to prison in 2015 and freed the following year after international criticism of her detention and trial.Energy PartnerThe U.S. helped Azerbaijan build oil and gas pipelines westward bypassing Russia. The EU regards Azerbaijan as a strategic energy partner and began talks in 2017 on a new framework agreement with Baku.While Aliyev and his late father Heydar, who ruled Azerbaijan for 10 years before his death in 2003, refused to join Russian-led military and economic blocs, U.S. and EU criticism of the poor state of democracy and human rights in Azerbaijan have strained relations. Aliyev won a landslide to secure a fourth term and extend his rule for seven years in 2018 elections seen as flawed by Western observers and boycotted by opposition parties.The president is \u201cquite sincere\u201d in his opposition to European integration because \u201cEurope means democracy, free elections, rule of law, universal human rights and social welfare,\u201d Altay Goyushov, an opposition politician who heads the Baku Research Institute, a think tank in the city, wrote on Facebook.\u201cAliyev wants to see a medieval monarchy in Azerbaijan,\u201d he said.To contact the reporter on this story: Zulfugar Agayev in Baku at zagayev@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Torrey Clark at tclark8@bloomberg.net, Tony HalpinFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P."

      "Date": "Tue, 26 Nov 2019 09:18:27 -0500",
      "Link": "https://news.yahoo.com/epstein-suicide-guards-theyre-scapegoats-132249169.html",
      "Discription": "NEW YORK -- Two jail guards who were on duty when Jeffrey Epstein killed himself browsed the internet and napped during the night before his body was found, instead of checking on him every half-hour as they were required to do, prosecutors have said. The guards then lied, prosecutors said, on official logs, indicating that they had made the rounds when they had not.Attorney General William Barr said last week that Epstein's death resulted from \"a perfect storm of screw-ups.\"But lawyers for the guards, who have been criminally charged, suggested in court Monday that their clients were being made into scapegoats for larger problems in the federal prison system that contributed to Epstein's death.The Manhattan jail where Epstein hanged himself has long been plagued by staff shortages and the two guards, Michael Thomas and Tova Noel, had already done several tours of overtime that week.In addition, Epstein was left alone without a cellmate that night and morning, even though he had tried to take his own life about three weeks earlier.\"Unfortunately, the decisions that led to the death of Mr. Epstein were not only because of what my client did or did not do,\" Montell Figgins, the lawyer for Thomas, said. \"It was because of a system that failed completely.\"\"Where are the supervisors?\" Figgins added. \"Where are the people who make the policy decisions? Why didn't Mr. Epstein have a cellmate at the time that this happened?\"Figgins made his remarks outside U.S. District Court in Manhattan after a hearing at which Judge Analisa Torres set a trial date of April 20 for Thomas and Noel, who face charges that include making false records and conspiracy to defraud the United States. Both have pleaded not guilty.Noel's lawyer, Jason E. Foy, said that he had not seen the evidence against his client, but he vowed to investigate her case vigorously. He said he believed there were \"outside circumstances that are driving this prosecution.\"Foy, who also spoke after the hearing, said the charges did not \"sound like your regular false-document case,\" an apparent reference to the unusual circumstances and high-profile nature of Epstein's death.The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan and the Bureau of Prisons declined to comment on the lawyers' assertions.The indictment charging the two guards highlighted lapses in the operation of a high-security unit at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, where Epstein, a financier, was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges when he died.The indictment also offered the first official narrative of the events preceding his death. It said that security cameras did not show anyone entering the cell block where Epstein was housed, suggesting that despite the conjecture and conspiracy theories swirling around Epstein and his connections to powerful people, his death was a suicide as New York City's chief medical examiner ruled.At the hearing Monday, a prosecutor, Rebekah A. Donaleski, told Torres that the discovery materials the government would provide to defense lawyers included hundreds of hours of video recordings from inside the jail.Although Donaleski did not elaborate on the recordings' contents, the indictment said that video obtained from the jail's internal video surveillance system confirmed that no one visited the tier where Epstein was being held after about 10:30 p.m. on Aug. 9.\"This was the last time anyone, including any correctional officer, walked up to, let alone entered, the only entrance to the tier in which Epstein was housed until approximately 6:30 a.m. on Aug. 10,\" when his body was found, the indictment said.The defense lawyers said in court that they wanted prosecutors to provide them with additional evidence that might be used at trial. Figgins cited an internal investigation by the Justice Department inspector general's office into the circumstances surrounding Epstein's death. The results of that inquiry will not be made public, officials have said.Outside the courthouse, Figgins said that there had been an unfair \"rush to judgment\" in the case and that the two guards were being made to pay for the problems of an entire system.\"Does anyone think that throughout the United States that these are the only two guards that may have taken a nap overnight on their shift?\" he said. \"I highly doubt it.\"The attention that Epstein's suicide has brought to prison conditions, inmate supervision and mental health issues around the country was reinforced Sunday with a letter published in The New York Times by Richard M. Berman, the federal judge in Manhattan who presided in Epstein's criminal case before his suicide.Berman wrote that the indictment of the two guards was not the \"full accounting\" to which Epstein's alleged victims, the public and his family were entitled.\"We all agree that it is unthinkable that any detainee, let alone a high-profile detainee like Mr. Epstein, would die unnoticed at the Metropolitan Correctional Center,\" the judge wrote.He said it would be \"a tragic and costly missed opportunity\" for the Bureau of Prisons and the attorney general \"to fail to undertake -- and to make public -- an in-depth evaluation of prison conditions (not only at the MCC) and to carry out appropriate reforms.\"This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company"

Few people actually read the Mueller Report, of course, and if McGahn says in public, on national TV, what he apparently said to Mueller\u2019s investigators, Trump\u2019s public support could drop substantially, and it could lock in an obstruction count in whatever articles the House draws up.But that\u2019s not even the biggest potential problem McGahn\u2019s testimony could pose for Trump.Testimony from Roger Stone\u2019s trial raised new questions regarding whether Trump lied in his written deposition to Mueller concerning whether he ever discussed WikiLeaks with Stone.\u00a0Being caught lying to Mueller would, of course, be a very big deal. Don\u2019t forget, Bill Clinton wasn\u2019t brought down because of sex, but because of perjury. Michael Flynn was convicted of lying to the FBI. One of the charges Stone was convicted of was lying to Congress. If McGahn has to go up to the Hill and\u2014under oath\u2014answer whether the president lied or instructed him to lie in that written testimony, it would be a bombshell moment. And if McGahn were to testify that Trump did, in fact, lie to Mueller, that could be (I\u2019m going to sound insane here, I know) enough to cause some Republican attrition. \u00a0As this all suggests Monday\u2019s court decision might\u2014MIGHT\u2014end up being one of the most underrated developments of this saga.\u00a0But it\u2019s not just about McGahn.\u00a0An equally consequential outcome of this court ruling could be that it makes it more likely that other top Executive Branch members\u2014possibly including former National Security Adviser John Bolton\u2014will testify.This might still be a long shot, but it\u2019s not entirely crazy. In early November, Bolton\u2019s lawyer sent a letter to the House saying his client \u201cwas personally involved in many of the events, meetings, and conversations about which you have already received testimony, as well as many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far.\u201dWhy would Bolton\u2019s lawyer tease us like that? There seem to be two possible answers: Either Bolton is craving media attention, or he is looking for an excuse that would permit him to overcome the executive-privilege objections. If it\u2019s the latter, the McGahn decision\u2014which will surely be appealed\u2014could at least provide a cover rationale.Another rationale for Bolton to comply with his subpoena: During her testimony, Fiona Hill might have provided such an excuse when she alleged that EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland \u201cwas being involved in a domestic political errand\u201d while she was \u201cinvolved in a national-security foreign policy. And those two things had just diverged.\u201d\u00a0This could potentially open the door for senior aides like Bolton (and Rudy Giuliani, Mike Pompeo, and Mick Mulvaney) to remain exempt from discussing national-security issues, while also being compelled to discuss this \u201cdomestic political errand,\u201d which \u201cdiverged.\u201dRegardless of how this plays out, Monday\u2019s court ruling reinforces a point I\u2019ve been making to the naysayers who believe impeachment is a fool\u2019s errand. Once you start subpoenaing witnesses and accruing on-the-record testimony, it\u2019s impossible to predict how one development might lead to another (just as testimony in the Stone trial might now play a major role in the impeachment inquiry).\u00a0Additionally, sometimes, once you start the process, you get lucky. In this instance, however, Republicans seem to have drawn the short straw with Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, an Obama appointee, whose questions during oral arguments last month seemed to signal she would rule in favor of the House.We are now looking at the possibility of a pincer move on Trump, involving McGahn and Bolton: The former gets him on lying, the latter on trying to rig the next election. If that happens, Trump\u2019s political future is over. It might be time to start heading to the bunker.\u00a0 \u00a0Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.
